## About

_Hamilcar_ is a software package for _Wolfram_ (formerly _Mathematica_) designed to provide robust tools for agentic systems to perform Hamiltonian analysis in canonical field theory. The overall goal is to enable AI agents and automated systems to conduct sophisticated field theory calculations through well-defined interfaces.

The package focuses on canonical field theory calculations in 3+1 dimensions, where the action $S$ has the structure
```math
S=\int\mathrm{d}t\int\mathrm{d}^3x\ \Big[\pi_\psi(x,t)\cdot\dot{\psi}(x,t)-H(\psi,\pi_\psi)\Big],
```
where the ingredients are:
- The dynamical fields $\psi(x,t)$ are real tensors on the spatial manifold, which may be a collection of distinct fields, each field having some collection of spatial indices ($a$, $b$, etc.), perhaps with some symmetry among the indices.
- The conjugate momenta $\pi_\psi(x,t)$ are the canonical momenta conjugate to the fields $\psi(x,t)$.
- The Hamiltonian density $H(\psi,\pi_\psi)$ is constructed from the fields, momenta, spatial metric, and spatial derivatives.

## Example: scalar field theory

As a demonstration, we consider a simple scalar field theory in 3+1 dimensions
```math
S=\int\mathrm{d}^4x\ \Big[-\tfrac{1}{2}\partial^\mu\phi\partial_\mu\phi+\tfrac{1}{2}m^2\phi^2\Big],
```
where $m$ is the mass parameter.

In a fresh notebook we first load the package:
```mathematica
<<xAct`Hamilcar`;
```
Next, we define a scalar field using the command `DefCanonicalField`:
```mathematica
DefCanonicalField[Phi[],FieldSymbol->"\[Phi]",MomentumSymbol->"\[Pi]"];
```
We can then compute Poisson brackets between quantities:
```mathematica
PoissonBracket[Phi[],ConjugateMomentumPhi[]];
```

## Documentation 

Comprehensive documentation with worked examples is available as an interactive Mathematica notebook at `xAct/Hamilcar/Documentation/English/Documentation.nb`. This documentation includes:

- **General Relativity**: Complete walkthrough of the ADM formalism, including constraint definitions, smearing functions, and computation of the Dirac hypersurface deformation algebra
- **Maxwell Theory**: Canonical electromagnetic field theory demonstrating Gauss constraint analysis and the Dirac algorithm

To access the documentation, open the notebook file in Mathematica:
```mathematica
NotebookOpen["xAct/Hamilcar/Documentation/English/Documentation.nb"]
```

This provides an interactive notebook with all calculations, explanations, and mathematical results ready to execute.

## Agentic Integration

While _Hamilcar_ currently provides a comprehensive _Mathematica_ interface for canonical field theory calculations, the ultimate goal is to enable seamless integration with agentic systems. The requisite **JSON-RPC interface** that will allow AI agents to programmatically access Hamilcar's functionality is **yet to be developed**.

This future interface will enable:
- Automated constraint algebra analysis
- Programmatic field theory calculations
- Integration with larger agentic workflows
- Standardized communication protocols for field theory operations

## General use 

### Pre-defined geometry

When you first run `` <<xAct`Hamilcar` `` the software defines a three-dimensional spatial hypersurface with the ingredients:

| _Wolfram Language_      | Output format                    | Meaning                                                                                     |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `a`, `b`, `c`, ..., `z` | $a$, $b$, $c$, ... $z$           | Spatial coordinate indices (corresponding to _adapted_ coordinates in the ADM prescription) |
| `G[-a,-b]`              | $h_{ab}$                         | Induced metric on the spatial hypersurface                                                  |
| `CD[-a]@`               | $\nabla_{a}$                     | Spatial covariant derivative                                                                |
| `epsilonG[-a,-b,-c]`    | $\epsilon_{abc}$                 | Induced totally antisymmetric tensor on the spatial hypersurface                            |

For those familiar with _xAct_, note that calls to `DefManifold` and `DefMetric` are made internally at this stage. The package establishes a spatial manifold `M3`, creating the necessary geometric structure for canonical field theory calculations.

### Function `DefCanonicalField`

```mathematica
DefCanonicalField[<Fld>[]]
```
defines a scalar canonical field `<Fld>` and its conjugate momentum `ConjugateMomentum<Fld>`.
```mathematica
DefCanonicalField[<Fld>[<Ind1>,<Ind2>,...]]
```
defines a tensor canonical field `<Fld>` and its conjugate momentum `ConjugateMomentum<Fld>` with indices `<Ind1>`, `<Ind2>`, etc..
```mathematica
DefCanonicalField[<Fld>[<Ind1>,<Ind2>,...],<Symm>]
```
defines a tensor canonical field `<Fld>` and its conjugate momentum `ConjugateMomentum<Fld>` with indices `<Ind1>`, `<Ind2>`, etc. and symmetry `<Symm>`.

#### Details and options

- The syntax of `DefCanonicalField` follows similar patterns to `DefTensor` in _xTensor_.
- Any number of comma-separated indices may be drawn from the contravariant `a`, `b`, `c`, up to `z`, the covariant `-a`, `-b`, `-c`, up to `-z`, or any admixture.
- The symmetry `<Symm>` can be one of the following (or any admixture allowed by `DefTensor`):
	- `Symmetric[{<SymmInd1>,<SymInd2>,...}]` denotes symmetrized indices.
	- `Antisymmetric[{<SymmInd1>,<SymInd2>,...}]` denotes antisymmetrized indices.
- If the global variable  `$DynamicalMetric` is set to `True`, then: 
	- The spatial metric `G` is automatically registered as a canonical field, and `ConjugateMomentumG` is defined.
	- All conjugate momenta are automatically defined as tensor densities of weight one (the effects of this are only seen by the `G`-variations performed internally by `PoissonBracket`).
- The following options may be given:
	- `FieldSymbol` is the symbol that `<Fld>` will use for display formatting.
	- `MomentumSymbol` is the symbol that the conjugate momentum will use for display formatting.

### Function `PoissonBracket`

```mathematica
PoissonBracket[<Op1>,<Op2>]
```
computes the Poisson bracket between operators `<Op1>` and `<Op2>`.

#### Details and options

- The operators `<Op1>` and `<Op2>` must be expressions involving:
	- Canonical fields and their conjugate momenta which have been defined using `DefCanonicalField`.
	- Tensors which have been defined on the manifold `M3` using `DefTensor`, and which are assumed always to be independent of the canonical fields.
	- Derivatives via `CD` of canonical and non-canonical quantities, the spatial metric `G`, and the totally antisymmtric tensor `epsilonG`.
	- Constant symbols which have been defined using `DefConstantSymbol` (or `DefNiceConstantSymbol` from the _xTras_ package).
- The function automatically generates smearing tensors unless `$ManualSmearing` is set to `True`.
- When `$DynamicalMetric` is set to `True`, the `G`-sector contributions are included.
- The function computes variational derivatives with respect to all registered fields and momenta.

### Function `TotalFrom`

```mathematica
TotalFrom[<Expr>]
```
expands composite expressions to canonical variable form by applying all registered expansion rules.

#### Details and options

- The function converts composite quantities (like constraint expressions, traces, or field combinations) into explicit expressions involving only the fundamental canonical variables: fields, conjugate momenta, and their spatial derivatives.
- This expansion is essential before computing Poisson brackets, as bracket calculations require expressions to be written in terms of the canonical variables registered by `DefCanonicalField`.
- The function applies all rules stored in the internal list `$FromRulesTotal`, which are populated using `PrependTotalFrom`.

### Function `TotalTo`

```mathematica
TotalTo[<Expr>]
```
converts expressions from canonical variable form back to compact notation using registered contraction rules.

#### Details and options

- The function performs the inverse operation of `TotalFrom`, converting expressions written in terms of canonical variables back to more compact composite notation.
- This is primarily used for presentation purposes to make final results more readable.
- The function applies all rules stored in the internal list `$ToRulesTotal`, which are populated using `PrependTotalTo`.
- Unlike `TotalFrom`, this function is optional in most calculations.

### Function `PrependTotalFrom`

```mathematica
PrependTotalFrom[<Rule>]
```
registers an expansion rule to convert a composite quantity to canonical variable form.

#### Details and options

- The function adds `<Rule>` to the front of the internal list `$FromRulesTotal` used by `TotalFrom`.
- Typically used with `MakeRule` expressions that define composite quantities in terms of canonical variables.
- Essential for setting up the expansion system before performing Poisson bracket calculations.
- Example usage: `FromSuperHamiltonian//PrependTotalFrom` registers the rule to expand the super-Hamiltonian constraint.

### Function `PrependTotalTo`

```mathematica
PrependTotalTo[<Rule>]
```
registers a contraction rule to convert canonical variable expressions back to compact notation.

#### Details and options

- The function adds `<Rule>` to the front of the internal list `$ToRulesTotal` used by `TotalTo`.
- Used with rules that convert expanded canonical expressions back to composite quantities.
- Provides the symmetric counterpart to `PrependTotalFrom` for bidirectional transformations.
- Less commonly used than `PrependTotalFrom` as conversion back to compact form is often optional.

### Function `FindAlgebra`

This function is undocumented and under active development. The purpose of the function is to determine constraint algebroids.

### Function `TimeD`

This function is undocumented and under active development. The purpose of the function is to manage time derivatives of fields.
